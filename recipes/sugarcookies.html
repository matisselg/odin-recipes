                                <li>1 tbsp room temperature water</li>
                                <li>2 tbsp hot water</li>
                                <li>1/2 cup maple syrup</li>
                                <li>1/2 cup coconut oil melted</li>
                                <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                                <li>1/4 cup coconut butter for frosting</li>

                        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
                                <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
                                <li>In a large bowl, stir together coconut flour, tapioca starch, cinnamon, sea salt, and baking soda.</li>
                                <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together gelatin and room-temperature water. Add hot water and whisk until the gelatin is dissolved.</li>
                                <li>Add maple syrup, coconut oil, and vanilla extract to the gelatin mixture and whisk together.</li>
                                <li>Slowly add wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, while stirring with a fork.</li>
                                <li>Mix until combined and moldable</li>
                                <li>Using rounded tablespoons, drop the cookie dough on the parchment paper. It might seem sticky, but it'll be easier to work once they are dropped.</li>
                                <li>Wet your hands slightly and roll the dropped dough into balls and flatten them.</li>
                                <li>Bake for 10-15 minutes until the edges are golden, but the cookies are still soft.</li>
                                <li>Let cool for 15 minutes. The cookies will harden as they cool.</li>
                                <li>Warm up coconut butter in the microwave or stovetop until slightly melted, but still thick and creamy. Spoon gently over cookies, and sprinkle with cinnamon. Let cool completely before serving.The coconut butter will solidify once cooled.</li>
                            </ol>
