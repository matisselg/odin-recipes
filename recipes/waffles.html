                        <h3>Optional Add-Ins:</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                                <li>1/2 tsp cinnamon</li>
                                <li>1 Tbsp flaxseed meal</li>
                                <li>1/4 cup dairy-free chocolate chips</li>
                                <li>1/4 cup chopped bananas or other fresh fruit</li>
                            </ul>
                        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Combine almond milk and vinegar in a small mixing bowl and let set for a few minutes to curdle/activate. 
                                    Then add olive oil, agave nectar or maple syrup and whisk. Set aside.</li>
                                <li>Add dry ingredients to a large mixing bowl and whisk until well combined. 
                                    Then add wet ingredients to dry and mix until well incorporated. 
                                    The mixture will be slightly thick and scoopable (not too gloppy, not pourable). 
                                    If too thick, thin with a bit of almond milk. If too thin, add a bit more flour.</li>
                                <li>Test batter for sweetness and flavor.  
                                    Add more sweetener or some vanilla extract if desired. 
                                    I added a touch more agave.</li>
                                <li>Let set for 5-10 minutes while your waffle iron preheats. 
                                    NOTE: We also tested these in a nonstick Belgian waffle iron and found that 
                                    while the waffles did not have any issues with sticking, 
                                    they didn&apos;t always fully cook on the inside. 
                                    If using a Belgian-style waffle maker, 
                                    we recommend cooking waffles on the medium heat setting but for a longer time 
                                    (two rounds) and letting them rest for 5-10 minutes after cooking for best texture.</li>
                                <li>Once waffle iron is ready, generously coat with non-stick spray or oil and pour on about 
                                    1/2 cup of batter. Cook according to manufacturer instructions, 
                                    but cook on the longer range of your waffle iron&apos;s suggestion. 
                                    We find gluten-free waffles tend to take a little longer to cook than gluten waffle. 
                                    And if you open the waffle iron too early they&apos;re more prone to sticking.</li>
                                <li>Once waffle is cooked, carefully remove from waffle maker and place on a baking rack in a 
                                    200 degree F (90 C) oven to keep warm. Do not stack; instead, 
                                    keep them in a single layer to ensure they remain crispy.</li>
                                <li>Serve immediately with desired toppings, such as fresh cherry-berry compote 
                                    and more maple syrup. Store leftovers in a freezer safe bag and 
                                    reheat in the toaster for best results (see notes for more instructions). 
                                    Will keep in the freezer for up to a couple of months, although they &apos; re freshest 
                                    within the first couple of weeks.</li>
